# NeuralNetworkAchitectureOptimization

## Igor Ratajczyk, Eng

Project for Introduction to Neural Networks classes @ AGH UST.

Files description:

### Solution_Ratajczyk

* Notebook consist of architecture test for simple problems of both classification and regression.
* Any further details are described in notebook itself.

### Ratajczyk_CNN_optimization

* Notebook approaches the similar problem of fine-tuning NN architecture but extends the search for CNN. 
* In general problem of training on exiguous dataset is being proceeded.

### CNN_visualization_Ratajczyk

* Aforementioned models generated in Ratajczyk_CNN_optimization notebook are being visualized including layers, max activation, heatmap activation visualizations.
* Notebook to be translated into English.
